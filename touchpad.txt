# If you accidentally disable the touchpad (Fn+F5) and can't re-enable it
# because that mapping has been hijacked for hibernation, then try:
xinput list
# to get the device number of the touchpad (13 last time)
# then
xinput list-props 13
# to have a squiz at its current settings, but what should really fix it is
xinput set-prop 13 "Device Enabled" 1
