# use latexdiff with git
# read:
http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1325/using-latexdiff-with-git
# and
http://eothred.wordpress.com/2010/11/07/latexdiff-and-git/
# then
git clone git://gitorious.org/latexbatchdiff/latexbatchdiff.git
# and execute the install rather than the README
cd latexbatchdiff
./install.sh
# add to path
export PATH=$PATH:/home/nacnudus/.local/bin
#to use the script, you then follow the usage which can be seen with the command "latexdiff-git" or "latexdiff-git -h".

#Example usage:

latexdiff-git ebc3e0 master.tex parts/introduction.tex parts/results.tex

#In this example, we want to see what has changed since revision ebc3e0 in files master.tex, parts/introduction.tex and parts/results.tex. The resulting diff file will be compiled using pdflatex.
