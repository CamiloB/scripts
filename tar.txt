# tar binds up files and folders into a single archive, which is easy to handle (move, copy, etc.)

# It can also compress the archives various ways.  The most common way is gzip compression.

# .tar is an archive, .tar.gz is a compressed archive.

# Create a .tar.gz archive.
tar -cvzf [archivename].tar.gz [file] [file]...

# -c archive it
# -v verbose
# -z using gzip compression
# -f to the specified archive name (this has to be the final flag)

# uncompress by replacing "-c" with "-x"

# use bzip2 by replacing "-z" with "-j"
